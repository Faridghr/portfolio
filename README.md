### AutoBuddy
In this project, we aim to develop a domain-specific chatbot application that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for natural language understanding and processing, combined with the efficiency and scalability of a vector database for data storage and retrieval. The application will implement the Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) method to enhance the chatbot's ability to provide accurate and relevant responses by integrating retrieved information with generative AI capabilities. We also fine-tune GPT-4o-mini in this project with related data to achieve optimal performance.

### ProductScraper
This project scrapes product information from the Digikala e-commerce website to extract details about available laptops, such as price, model, CPU, GPU, RAM, screen size, etc. The extracted data is stored in a MySQL database using the mysql library. Additionally, the project includes a simple machine learning model built with scikit-learn for predicting laptop prices based on user input configurations.

### DesignPatterns-RestaurantOrdering
This project is a practical exploration of design patterns, applied to a restaurant ordering system. It demonstrates how design patterns can be used to solve real-world software design challenges, resulting in a system that is flexible, scalable, and maintainable. The project utilizes multiple design patterns, including Singleton, Factory, Builder, Strategy, Composite, Adapter, Decorator, and Observer, to create a robust and extensible solution.
